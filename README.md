# Text Analytics

Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook

Programming Language Used: Python 3.x

Aim is to cover how text analytics is currently used to find important regularities and discover meaning in big data. Here we will cover the fundamental techniques and their implementation with their applications areas where text analytics is deployed.

This comprises of the following sub items: 
1. Pre Processing of the raw text
2. Calculating the Term Frequency/ Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF)
3. Similarity among textual data
4. Supervised algorithm with natural language data ranging from kNN to SVM algorithms
5. Unsupervised algorithm with natural language data.
6. Critical aspect: Evaluation of all the algorithms performed on the textual data.
7. Inter - Rater Reliability for sentiment analysis.
8. Use of Sentiments using KL Divergence.

You can find all the implementations with their examples mentioned above.
